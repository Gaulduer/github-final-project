## This is just a repository I am creating to finish a certificate on coursera
## And apparently, this is what the project is:
A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.
Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
Output
   simple interest = p*t*r
